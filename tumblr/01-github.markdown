Today we're excited to announce the release of all of our _Code with me_ presentation slides on Github, on our [<img src="https://github.com/github/media/blob/master/octocats/blacktocat-32.png?raw=true"/>codewithme/main-curriculum](https://github.com/codewithme/main-curriculum) repo.

While we've had the presentations available online since both our D.C. and Miami workshops, there hasn't been a way for interested parties to easily download all our presentation files in one fell swoop. The extra benefit of downloading, is that you get to see the secret speaker notes that we've embedded into the presentations. One of us uses them far more than the other, but we'll let you guess who.

Please feel free to poke around, fork the repo, use it yourself, keeping in mind the following:

### 1. Our License
We offer our teaching material under a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US): <strong>AAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported</strong>, which means you can share and adapt our work, as long as:

* Only distributed your altered work under the same Creative Commons license

We don't want anyone taking our material and making a profit. Instead, we want to encourage open collaboration, and the release of any adaptive work should be to the public.

If you have a commercial project in mind, and think we'd support it, please [contact us](mailto:team@codewithme.us). Please keep in mind that you cannot use even an adaptation of our curriculum for commercial purposes without explicit, written permission.

### 2. Our teaching style
Our presentations are being taught in our own _Code with me_ workshops, meaning that as students are learning, they have a mentor next to them, answering their questions. Many of our lessons also end with a list of items mentors will be showing their students how to do, so unless you have a similar setup, our curriculum isn't yet directly transportable. Of course, many of the slides that show core concepts will be fine on their own. However, this leads us to...

### 3. What we're working on next, teaching-wise
Within the next year, we'll be actively seeking ways for us to help make our curriculum and teaching style more portable and usable in many different teaching scenarios. If you are an educator or someone who teaches code, we'd love to hear what materials or tools would be helpful to you. Please [contact us](mailto:team@codewithme.us).
