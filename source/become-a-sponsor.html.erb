        <p><strong>Interested in sponsoring <em>Code with me</em>?</strong> Contact Tom and Sisi at <a href="mailto:team@codewithme.us" target="_blank">team@codewithme.us</a> with how you can help. We're also happy to dicsuss the best way your organization can help us.</p>

        <h3>Why sponsor <em>Code with me?</em></h3>
        <p>Support our high-impact efforts to help more journalists wield the tools of technology for even better storytelling.</p>

        <h4>Exposure to the local journalism & tech community</h4>
        <p>We believe in creating communities to help our students continue learning even after our workshop. By helping sponsor a local <em>Code with me</em>, your organization gets exposure to both knowledgable journalists and developers in the field, as well as a student population interested in being part of, or creating, a journalism and technology community. On the second day of our Miami workshop, our students started their own <a href="http://miami.meetup.hackshackers.com/">Hacks/Hackers Miami</a> chapter.</p>

        <h4>Student profile</h4>
        <p>Our students are from a broad journalism background; they are professors, news directors, producers, photojournalists, documentarians, copy editors, designers, data journalists and reporters. They are interested in how they can use code to better journalistic storytelling. Many of them work at the news organizations located close to our workshop cities, such as the Washington Post, NPR, PBS NewsHour, Military Times, Virginian Pilot, Houston Chronicle, University of Miami, Miami Herald, WLRN, Palm Beach Post, Cinncinati Enquirer and Sarasota Herald-Tribune.</p>

        <h4>What your sponsorship means</h4>
        <ul class="bullet" style="padding-top:10px;">
            <li>Your help keeps our fee low, and ensures that unemployed journalists, freelancers and those without company support can afford to attend.</li>
            <li>Supports working journalists, professors and students in learning the foundations of programming, and how to continue learning afterwards</li>
        </ul>

<div id="needs" class="row workshop-row">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
        <h3>What we need</h3>
        <p>How far your sponsorship can go:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>$500 covers one of the four meals the workshop provides, or the thank-you dinner for the volunteer mentors</li>
            <li>$1,000 helps bring one out-of-town mentor to a low-resource community that needs us</li>
            <li>$5,000 helps us host an entire workshop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also need a free venue with a projector, sound system, power outlets and free wireless Internet, and:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Tables that can seat six or more people, as opposed to a classroom &mdash; it helps people work together</li>
            <li>People are allowed to eat while working</li>
            <li>Ideally, also a second room we can use for breakout sessions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Or, if you're interested in supporting the program in general, we also accept general financial donations.</p>

<div id="featured" class="row workshop-row">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
        <h3>How you'll be featured</h3>
        <p>Sponsor logos will be advertised prominently on the website for that workshop, as well as our introductory and wrap up presentations. We'll also be giving a verbal thanks during the workshop and we invite all sponsors to come say a few words about their organization when the program begins.</p>

<div id="independence" class="row workshop-row">
    <div class="eight columns offset-by-two">
        <h3>Independence from sponsors</h3>
        <p>Currently, <em>Code with me</em> will not co-brand its workshops.</p>
        <p>To help us avoid conflicts of interest when pursuing our <a href="about.html">mission statement</a>, sponsors will not be involved in the application process or mentor selection. Employees of sponsoring organizations will not be given special consideration.</p>
