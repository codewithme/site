      <h2>A workshop for beginners</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Learn to code with a mentor by your side</strong>. You've wanted to learn how to program, but the newsroom always needs you to do something else instead. Maybe you've even tried on your own, but it's hard without someone there to help. At  <em>Code with me</em>, a two-day workshop, we'll teach you how to code from the ground up so you can tell meaningful, interactive stories. 
      </p>
      <p>
          We're designed for <strong>journalists without coding experience</strong>. With one mentor for every two students, you'll always have the attention of a dedicated teacher so you can learn at your own pace, and never feel lost. With <%= workshop.mentors_cardinal %> mentors total, you'll join a supportive learning community that will continue on after the workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
          Plus, you'll have fun. You'll <strong>learn HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> by building your own interactive project. Our goal is to make this your turning point &mdash; an experience that not only teaches the basics of code, but gives you the skills and confidence you need to keep programming on your own and in your newsroom.
