        <h2>A workshop for beginners</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>You want to learn how to code</strong>, but the newsroom always needs you to do something else instead. Maybe you've even tried learning on your own, but it's hard without someone there to help. At  <em>Code with me</em>, a two-day workshop, we'll teach you how to code from the ground up so you can tell meaningful, interactive stories. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We're specifically designed for <strong>journalists without coding experience</strong>. With one mentor for every two students, you'll always have the attention of a dedicated teacher so you can learn at your own pace, and never feel lost or behind. With nine mentors total, you'll join a supportive learning community that will continue on after the workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plus, you'll have fun. You'll <strong>learn HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> by building your own interactive project. Our goal is to make this your turning point &mdash; an experience that not only teaches the basics of code, but gives you the skills and confidence you need to keep programming on your own and in your newsroom.
